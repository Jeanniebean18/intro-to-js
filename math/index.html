  <h1> Basic Math </h1>
  <h2>
    What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "Error 404"? How about "404 Error"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?
  </h2>
  <p>
    console.log(parseInt("Error 404")); // returns NAN
    console.log(parseInt("404 Error")); // returns 404
  </p>
  <p>
    The String needs to lead with a number for it to parse.
  </p>
  <h2>
    What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?
  </h2>
  <p> Seems to just return NaN.
  </p>
  <h2> 
    Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?
  </h2>
  <p> Pretty much anything we want to increment or keep track of rounds, password attempts, etc.
    <p>
      <h2>
        What questions do you have?
      </h2>
      <p> The incrementer and decrementer seems a little funky to me or at least not like Ruby. Here's my notes:
      </p>
      <p>
        var increment = (number_one++); // this value returns the original number, I assumed it would return the incremented number.
      </p>
      <p>
        alert(increment + "++" + "=" + number_one); // number_one is now incremented and increment is the original number.
      </p>
