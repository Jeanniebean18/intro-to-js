  <h2>
    Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?
  </h2>
  <p> Nope, because only one statement will apply to each input. Doesn't matter.
  </p>
  <h2>
    What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?
  </h2>
  <p> Well, you can't be both younger than 16 and older than 21.</p>
  <h2>
     Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?
  </h2>
  <p>You could definitely use variables. Each if statement is basically the same, they would just need to assign the new variables in ranges wanted.</p>
