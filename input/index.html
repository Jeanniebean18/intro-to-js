  <h1> Inputs and Outputs JavaScript </h1>
  
  <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.
  </h2>
  <p>
    Seems like it accepts everything as strings, even if mean't to be an integer such as age.
  </p>
  <h2>
    What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Everything still prompts and alerts, but no variable information is saved. Actually it might be an empty String since the datatype still returned String.
  <h2>
    How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?
  </h2>
  <p>
    I chose my variables based on the obvious values, but made them clear enough for someone else to realized what they stood for. ie favorite number, I didn't just name "number", I named it favNumber.
  </p>
  <h2>
    If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?
  </h2>
  <p> I think yes, it would make sense to rename the variable what information you were expecting to recieve. Seems like the reordering of questions does not affect the variables.
  </p>
  <h2>
    In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?
  </h2>
  <p> Most website use form inputs to collect information. I think this is what most people are used to now. Prompts seem old school to me. I think they are a bit intrusive and would annoy people. Also, forms can autosave information. If someone were to abandon and come back to the prompts, they would have to start over.
  </p> 
  <h2>
    Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?
  </h2>
  <p> Seems like no, although you can alert back to them more than one variable. Most people say you should just use a form :)
