  <h1> Equality Operators </h1>
  <h2>
    What do you call true and false values?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Similarly to Ruby, these are called booleans.
    <p/>
    <h2>
      How is true similar or dissimilar from "true"? Can they be used in the same way?
    </h2>
    <p>
      They are not the same. True is true in boolean form. "True" is just a string. They can't be used the same way.
