  <h1> Password Game </h1>
  <h2>
    What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?
  </h2>
  <p> A while loop is better as it is loops if the condition is not true.
  </p>
  <h2> Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Since the password is a string, I think it's safe just to use == or rather I used !=.
  </p>
  <h2>Stretches
  </h2>
  <p> I just changed the user input answer to downcase to accept all cases. 
    toLowerCase();
  </p>
  <p> Added counter to report tries.
