  <h2>
    Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?
  </h2>
  <p> It only matters if the order of alerts need to be displayed in a certain order, otherwise no, it doesn't matter.
  </p>
  <h2>
    When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?
  </h2>
  <p> I used && for the if (user_age <= 15 && user_age >= 0) </p>
  <p> Because the user's age must produce true for that if statement to happen. I couldn't
    really use || is this statement as both needed to be true, not one.
  
  <h2>
     What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?
  </h2>
  <p>If a string is parsed that cannot become an Integer, it returns NaN. </p>
  <p>
    If any input returns NaN, my if statement catches it and returns "not a number."
