  </h1>
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?
  </h2>
  <p> To save user values we can use again without inputting it everytime. It also will help when we use the variables several times in a website, if the variable changes, we won't need to change every instance of that variable.
  </p>
  <h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?
  </h2>
  <p> hairColor will help you better remember what kind of value that variable holds and is just more detailed. It takes longer to write, but remembering what that variable stands for and having other people read your code, it will be more clear.
  <h2> Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?
  </h2>
  <p> Maybe to remember a person's name throughout a website or other information. Might take the place of some ruby we've used?
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do? 
  </h2>
   <p> You only need the var when you are declaring/defining the variable. You don't need to use it everytime you call on the variable.
  <h2> What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?
  </h2>
  <p>  It does error. It tells you that the variable is not defined.
