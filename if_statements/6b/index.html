  <h1> Password Game </h1>
  <h2>
    Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?
  </h2>
  <p> Yes, capitalization matters.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?
  </h2>
  <p>Using = should only be used to declare variables.  I believe you can use either == or ===. === is for comparing values that are of same value and datatype. But since we know both are strings, not sure that it matters.  </p>
  <h2>
      Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?
  </h2>
  <p> Javascript can be read in the browser, so it's probably a bad idea to store info here.
