  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>

  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>alert(), is an alert to the user in the form of the pop-up window.</p>
  <p>console.log(), is for writing messages to the console.  The interpreter doesn't print out every single thing it does. So if we want to know what it's thinking, we sometimes have to ask it to speak to us. Console.log() will take whatever is inside the parentheses and log it to the console below our code.
  </p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p> If the user has forgotten to enter information into a form. You can use JS alert to prompt them to enter that info.</p>
 
  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>If you're reading something or looking through photos, a pop-up alert is always highly annoying.</p>

  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p> No, the user is not able to see the console logs without doing extra work. Makes for a bad UX.
    
    <h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
    <p>It would be good for debugging. <p.>
  
      <h2> When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
      <p>The console log statements are ran in order of the javascript code. In this case, it was ran after the user click ok to the first alert.</p>
